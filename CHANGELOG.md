## [9.2.0] - 2025-11-13

### ✨ Features

**Workflow Orchestration Awareness (MAJOR FEATURE)**

Roo Commander now understands project lifecycle stages and proactively guides users through workflow best practices.

**What's New:**
- **Workflow Intelligence**: Recognizes 7 lifecycle stages (Exploration → Planning → Execution → Wrap → Resume → Feature → Release)
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Automatically suggests workflow commands at appropriate times
- **Context Monitoring**: Warns when context is filling up (70%, 85%) and suggests `/wrap-session`
- **New `/workflow` Command**: Interactive guide showing current project state and available commands

**New Rule File:**
- `src/templates/rules-roo-commander/03-workflow-orchestration.md` (~450 lines)
  - Recognition patterns for each lifecycle stage
  - Proactive suggestion templates
  - Context monitoring rules
  - Decision trees for workflow vs skill delegation

**Updated Files:**
- `src/templates/rules-roo-commander/02-skill-routing.md` - Added "Workflow Commands vs Skills" distinction
- All 6 workflow commands now have `workflow-stage` metadata

**New Command:**
- `src/templates/commands/workflow.md` - Interactive lifecycle guide with context-aware recommendations

**How It Works:**

Before delegating technical work, Roo Commander now checks:
1. **Is this lifecycle-related?** → Suggest workflow command first
2. **Is implementation needed?** → Search skills → Delegate to Code mode

**Example Behaviors:**

| User Says | Roo Commander Suggests |
|-----------|------------------------|
| "I want to build a chat app" | `/explore-idea` to validate first or `/plan-project` to structure |
| "Add authentication" (existing project) | `/plan-feature` to integrate properly |
| [Context reaches 70%] | "⚠️ Use `/wrap-session` to checkpoint progress" |
| "Continue from yesterday" | `/continue-session` to load SESSION.md context |
| "Ready to publish" | `/release` for safety checks |

**Time Savings**: Workflow automation saves 35-55 minutes per project lifecycle by preventing:
- Unvalidated ideas leading to wasted implementation
- Context overflow losing work
- Missing project structure causing rework
- Release disasters (leaked secrets, broken builds)

**Migration**: No breaking changes. Existing functionality unchanged. New workflow awareness enhances orchestration.

## [9.1.0] - 2025-11-13

### ✨ Features

**Global Installation Support (MAJOR FEATURE)**

- **New Default**: `roocommander init` now installs globally by default - mode appears in ALL projects
- **Project Mode**: Use `--project` flag for project-scoped installation (old behavior)
- **Crown Emoji**: Changed from 🎯 to 👑 for Roo Commander mode

**Installation Modes**:

```bash
# Global (default) - Install once, use everywhere
roocommander init
→ Writes to ~/.config/Code/.../custom_modes.yaml
→ Copies rules to ~/.roo/rules-roo-commander/
→ Mode appears in ALL Roo Code projects

# Project-scoped - Install per project
roocommander init --project
→ Writes to ./.roomodes in current directory
→ Copies rules to ./.roo/
→ Mode appears only in this project
```

**Why Global?**
- Install once, available everywhere
- No need to run `init` in every project
- Cleaner project directories (no `.roomodes` file unless needed)
- Can still override per-project with `--project` flag

**Changes**:
- `src/commands/init.ts`: Complete rewrite to support both global and project modes
- `src/installer/global-installer.ts`: New module with cross-platform global installation
- `src/cli.ts`: Added `--project` flag to init command
- `src/templates/.roomodes-entry.yaml`: Changed emoji from 🎯 to 👑

**Migration**:
```bash
# Upgrade CLI
npm install -g roocommander@latest

# Install globally (recommended)
roocommander init

# Reload VS Code
# Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window

# Mode now appears in all projects!
```

**Breaking Changes**: None - `--project` flag preserves old behavior

---

## [9.0.4] - 2025-11-11

### 🐛 Fixed

**CRITICAL: Mode Still Not Appearing (Final Fix)**

- **Issue**: Two remaining schema violations preventing mode from appearing in Roo Code extension
- **Impact**: Mode would not load even after v9.0.3 emoji fix
- **Root Causes**:
  1. **Missing `whenToUse` field** - Required for Orchestrator mode to know when to suggest the mode
  2. **Invalid `customInstructions` format** - Was array of file paths, should be inline string or omitted entirely

**What Was Wrong**:
```yaml
# ❌ INVALID (v9.0.0-9.0.3)
customModes:
  - slug: roo-commander
    name: 🎯 Roo Commander
    # Missing: whenToUse field
    customInstructions:  # ❌ File paths not supported
      - .roo/rules/01-skills-index.md
      - .roo/rules/02-cli-usage.md

# ✅ VALID (v9.0.4)
customModes:
  - slug: roo-commander
    name: 🎯 Roo Commander
    whenToUse: Use this mode when starting new features...  # ✅ Added
    # customInstructions removed - using .roo/rules-roo-commander/ files instead
```

**Why This Matters**:
- `whenToUse` tells Roo Code's Orchestrator mode when to suggest this mode
- `customInstructions` expects inline content, NOT file paths
- File-based instructions work via `.roo/rules-roo-commander/` directory (loaded automatically)

**Changes**:
- `src/templates/.roomodes-entry.yaml`: Added `whenToUse` field, removed invalid `customInstructions` array
- All mode-specific instructions remain in `.roo/rules-roo-commander/` (correct approach)

**Migration**: All users MUST upgrade and reinstall:
```bash
npm install -g roocommander@latest
cd your-project
roocommander init --force
# Reload VS Code: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window
```

**Verification**: Mode should now appear in `/mode` selector after VS Code reload.

---

## [9.0.3] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Fixed

**CRITICAL: Mode Not Appearing in Roo Code Extension**

- **Issue**: `.roomodes` template had invalid `emoji` field causing Roo Code to reject the mode
- **Impact**: Mode would not appear in mode selector even after correct installation and VS Code reload
- **Root Cause**: Template used non-existent `emoji:` property instead of including emoji in `name` field
- **Fix**: Removed `emoji: 🎯` line and changed `name: Roo Commander` to `name: 🎯 Roo Commander`

**What Was Wrong**:
```yaml
# ❌ INVALID (v9.0.0-9.0.2)
- slug: roo-commander
  name: Roo Commander
  emoji: 🎯  # <-- Not a valid Roo Code property!

# ✅ VALID (v9.0.3)
- slug: roo-commander
  name: 🎯 Roo Commander  # Emoji in name field
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Roo Code extension parses `.roomodes` and rejects modes with invalid properties
- Invalid `emoji` field caused silent failure - no error message, mode just didn't load
- This affected ALL users in v9.0.0, v9.0.1, and v9.0.2

**Changes**:
- `src/templates/.roomodes-entry.yaml`: Removed `emoji:` field (line 15), added emoji to `name` field (line 14)

**Migration**: All users MUST upgrade and reinstall:
```bash
npm install -g roocommander@latest
cd your-project
roocommander init --force
# Reload VS Code: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window
```

**Manual Fix** (for users who can't wait for upgrade):
1. Edit `.roomodes` in your project root
2. Find: `name: Roo Commander` and `emoji: 🎯`
3. Change to: `name: 🎯 Roo Commander` (remove the emoji line)
4. Save and reload VS Code

---

## [9.0.2] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Fixed

**Critical Fix**: Invalid `groups` value in .roomodes template

- **Issue**: Template used `groups: [workflow]` which is NOT a valid Roo Code tool group
- **Impact**: Mode may not load correctly in Roo Code extension or fail silently
- **Root Cause**: Used non-existent "workflow" group instead of official values
- **Fix**: Changed to `groups: [read, mcp]` (allows reading skills index and MCP access)
- **Valid Groups**: `read`, `edit`, `browser`, `command`, `mcp` (per official Roo Code docs)

**Documentation Improvements**:
- Fixed CLI command name in 3 locations (changed hyphenated `roo-commander` to `roocommander`)
  - `src/installer/github-cloner.ts:110` - Help text
  - `src/cli.ts:104` - Error message
  - `src/commands/init.ts:40` - Reinstall message
- Added prominent VS Code reload warning to init output (yellow warning + first step)
- Updated README version footer to 9.0.2

**Changes**:
- `src/templates/.roomodes-entry.yaml`: Changed `groups: [workflow]` → `groups: [read, mcp]`
- `src/commands/init.ts`: Added reload VS Code warning in output
- `src/installer/github-cloner.ts`: Fixed command name
- `src/cli.ts`: Fixed command name
- `README.md`: Updated version footer

**Why This Matters**:
- Invalid groups value could cause mode to be rejected by Roo Code extension
- Users won't see mode if they don't reload VS Code (root cause of v9.0.0/9.0.1 confusion)
- Wrong CLI command names cause copy/paste errors

**Migration**: Users should upgrade immediately:
```bash
npm install -g roocommander@latest
roocommander init --force
# Reload VS Code
```

---

## [9.0.1] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Fixed

**Critical Bug**: Roo Commander mode not appearing in VS Code Roo Code extension

- **Issue**: `.roomodes` file created by `roocommander init` had invalid YAML structure (bare array instead of `customModes: [array]`)
- **Impact**: Roo Code extension couldn't parse `.roomodes`, so custom mode never loaded in mode selector
- **Root Cause**: Template file (`src/templates/.roomodes-entry.yaml`) was missing `customModes:` wrapper key
- **Fix**:
  - Updated template to use proper `customModes: [array]` structure (line 12)
  - Updated installer parsing logic to handle `customModes` wrapper (line 210-217)
  - Updated merging logic to preserve `customModes` structure (line 223-266)
  - Added validation to ensure `customModes` key exists and is an array

**Changes**:
- `src/templates/.roomodes-entry.yaml`: Added `customModes:` wrapper, indented mode definition
- `src/installer/template-installer.ts`: Fixed parsing/merging to handle wrapped structure
- `README.md`: Added note about reloading VS Code after `roocommander init`

**Migration**: Users who ran `roocommander init` with v9.0.0 should:
1. Upgrade: `npm install -g roocommander@latest`
2. Reinstall: `roocommander init --force` (overwrites broken `.roomodes`)
3. Reload VS Code: Command Palette → "Developer: Reload Window"
